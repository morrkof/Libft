# Practice project: Libft
The goal of the project is to re-write several functions from the C standard library. My own library is compiled with a Makefile to static library **libft.a**.

### list of functions:
Name with signature | Description | Return value
------|-------|-------|
void \***ft_memset**(void *s, int c, size_t n) | Fills the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `c`. | A pointer to the memory area `s`.
void **ft_bzero**(void *s, size_t n) | Erases the data in the `n` bytes of the memory starting at the location pointed to by `s`, by writing zeros (bytes containing '\0') to that area. | None.
void \***ft_memcpy**(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n) | Copies `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`.  The memory areas must not overlap. | A pointer to `dest`.

char \***ft_strnstr**(const char *big, const char *little, size_t len) | Locates the first occurrence of the null-terminated string `little` in the string `big`, where not more than `len` characters are searched. | If `little` is an empty string, `big` is returned; if `little` occurs nowhere in `big`, NULL is returned; otherwise a pointer to the first character of the first occurrence of `little` is returned.
